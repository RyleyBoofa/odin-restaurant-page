# Odin Restaurant Page

Dynamically rendered restaurant page, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).

The page is inspired by the **Tranzit Diner** from _Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombies_. All content, including the various pages, is rendered dynamically using JavaScript modules and DOM manipulation. This project emphasizes separation of concerns, webpack bundling, and scalable project architecture.

Live preview can be found [here](https://ryleyboofa.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/).

# Features

-   **Dynamic Rendering:**
    -   Single-page structure with all content generated and swapped via JavaScript modules
    -   Navigation handled through header buttons without reloading
-   **Custom Styling:**
    -   CSS with layered gradient background, custom fonts, and themed color palette
    -   Layout designed to resemble an in-universe diner atmosphere
-   **JavaScript and Webpack:**
    -   Source code split into separate modules (home, menu, and about) for maintainability
    -   Bundled and optimized with webpack and npm for modern project structure

# Skills used

-   HTML: barebones template file used only as a container for JavaScript-rendered content
-   CSS: themed design, layered gradients, reusable classes for layout and styling
-   JavaScript: DOM manipulation, ES6 modules, event-handling
-   Webpack: bundling, asset management, module support
